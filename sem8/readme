# 🌱 EcoRestore

_EcoRestore_ is an intelligent system designed to aid sustainable agriculture by integrating **Soil Classification**, **Crop Recommendation**, and **Land Identification** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and machine learning techniques. The goal is to maximize agricultural productivity while maintaining ecological balance.

## 🧠 Key Features

- 🔍 **Soil Classification**  
  Classifies soil types based on features such as pH, texture, moisture, and nutrient content using machine learning and CNNs (for image-based classification).

- 🌾 **Crop Recommendation**  
  Suggests the most suitable crops based on the classified soil type, weather conditions, and regional data to enhance yield and sustainability.

- 🌍 **Land Identification via CNN**  
  Uses satellite imagery and remote sensing data with a CNN model to identify suitable agricultural lands by analyzing terrain, vegetation index, and land cover patterns.
