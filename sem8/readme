🌱 EcoRestore

EcoRestore is an intelligent system designed to aid sustainable agriculture by integrating 🧪 Soil Classification, 🌾 Crop Recommendation, and 🌍 Land Identification using 🧠 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and machine learning techniques. The goal is to maximize 🌾 agricultural productivity while maintaining 🌿 ecological balance.

🧠 Key Features

🔍 Soil Classification
Classifies soil types based on features such as pH, texture, moisture, and nutrient content using machine learning and CNNs (for image-based classification).

🌾 Crop Recommendation
Suggests the most suitable crops based on the classified soil type, weather conditions, and regional data to enhance yield and sustainability.

🌍 Land Identification via CNN
Uses satellite imagery and remote sensing data with a CNN model to identify suitable agricultural lands by analyzing terrain, vegetation index, and land cover patterns.
